====== DNSSEC ======

=== Q1. What does a validating resolver do?  ===

It works the same way as a normal resolver,
but has the DNSSEC added.
This means that it will verify the queries it sends by
checking the RRSIG on the DNSKEY and verify the RRSIG for the DS record.
The hash of the DS (located at parent) should match the public KSK
of the zone (child) one is querying.
All to verify that the chain of trust is not altered.

=== Q2. Add support for DNSSEC to your BIND or Unbound configuration  ===
== a. What changes do you have to make to your configuration?  == 

DNSSEC enabled in named.conf:
<code>
options {
directory "/usr/local/etc/bind";
//For dns labs we want recursion, for mail labs we do not
//recursion no;
allow-recursion { 0/0; };
fetch-glue yes;
//DNSSEC lab
dnssec-enable yes;
dnssec-validation auto;
};
//the auto will get the root DNSKEY (KSK=257) for us
//managed-keys {};
</code>
Bind can do 'managed-keys' itself when validation is set to auto.

== b. Verify the root key used against a trusted source  == 

=== Q3. Use dig or drill to verify the validity of DNS records for isc org and os3 nl Show the results  ===

=== Q4. How does dig / drill show whether DNSSEC validation was succesful or not?  ===

=== Q5. Where does BIND/Unbound store the DNSSEC root key?  ===

=== Q6. How do managed keys differ from trusted keys ? Which RFC describes the mechanisms for managed keys?  ===

=== Q7. How did you modify the DNSSEC root key?  ===

=== Q8. What problems did your server encounter and how did it react?  ===

=== Q9. Look up which cryptographic algorithms are available for use in DNSSEC Which one do you prefer and why?  ===

=== Q10. In practice different algorithms key sizes and key lifetimes are chosen for KSKs and ZSKs Discuss what are these differences in  ===
== a. algorithms  == 
== b. key sizes  == 
== c. key lifetimes  == 


=== Q11. Choose appropriate algorithms key sizes and key lifetimes for your KSK and ZSK  ===

=== Q12. Show the signed version of your zone file How does it differ from the unsigned version? Any unexpected differences?  ===

=== Q13. Which DS record do you need to send to Niels and why that one? Once Niels has implemented your DS record use a DNSSEC debugger to examine the chain of trust see http //dnssec-debugger verisignlabs com/ (use more detail ) or http //dnsviz net/  ===

=== Q14. Show the results of the examination of your secured domain  ===

=== Q15. Describe the DS and DNSKEY records from os3 nl down that are important for your domain Which keys are used to sign them?  ===

=== Q16. Start planning for a Zone Signing Key rollover  ===
== a. Describe the options for doing a ZSK rollover make a motivated choice for one procedure  == 
== b. How do you implement this procedure with the tools for signing your zone?  == 
== c. Which timers are important for this procedure?  == 
== d. Implement the procedure and use a DNSSEC debugger to verify each step Don't forget to show the results of each verification  == 

=== Q17. Can you use the same procedure for a KSK rollover? What does this depend on?  ===


==== BONUS ====

=== Q18. Integrity is important because you want your buddy to include the right DS records Is confidentiality also an issue? Explain  ===

=== Q19. Verify the integrity of your buddy's resource records using dig or drill Is the ad flag set?  ===

=== Q20. What are the main differences between NSEC and NSEC3?  ===

=== Q21. Does the root use NSEC or NSEC3? What about the org domain?  ===

=== Q22. How common is NSEC3?  ===
